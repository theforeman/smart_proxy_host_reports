# Smart Proxy Host Reports

Transforms configuration and security management reports into Foreman-friendly
JSON and sends them to a Foreman instance. For more information about Foreman
JSON report format, visit
[foreman_host_reports](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_host_reports).

## Usage

Send a POST HTTP call to `/host_reports/FORMAT` where FORMAT is one of the following formats.

### Puppet

Accepts Puppet Server YAML format:

* [Example input](test/fixtures/puppet6-foreman-web.yaml)
* [Example output](test/snapshots/foreman-web.json)

## Development setup

Few words about setting up a dev setup.

### Ansible

Checkoud foreman-ansible-modules and build it via `make` command. Configure
Ansible collection path to the build directory:

    [defaults]
    collection_path = /home/lzap/work/foreman-ansible-modules/build
    callback_whitelist = foreman
    [callback_foreman]
    url = http://localhost:8448/host_reports
    verify_certs = 0
    client_cert = /home/lzap/DummyX509/client-one.crt
    client_key = /home/lzap/DummyX509/client-one.key

Configure Foreman Ansible callback with the correct Foreman URL:

Then call Ansible:

    ANSIBLE_LOAD_CALLBACK_PLUGINS=1 ansible localhost -m ping -vvv

## Example data

For testing, there are several example data. Before importing them into Foreman, make sure to have `localhost` smart proxy and also a host named `report.example.com`.

### Importing into Foreman directly

To import a report directly info Foreman:

```
curl -H "Accept:application/json,version=2" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST -d @test/snapshots/foreman-web.json http://localhost:5000/api/v2/host_reports
```

### Puppet

To install and configure a Puppetserver on EL7, run the following:

```bash
# Install the server - modify as needed for your platform
yum -y install https://yum.puppet.com/puppet7-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
yum -y install puppetserver
# Correct $PATH in the current shell - happens on start of fresh shells automatically
source /etc/profile.d/puppet-agent.sh
# Configure the HTTP report processor
puppet config set reports store,http
puppet config set reporturl http://$HOSTNAME:8000/host_reports/puppet
# Enable & start the service
systemctl enable --now puppetserver
```

By default an agent connects to `puppet` which may not resolve. Set it to your hostname:

```bash
puppet config set server $HOSTNAME
```

You can manually trigger a puppet run by using `puppet agent -t`. You may need to look at `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log` to see errors.
